	Last week was my last week in my work. I left my 9-6 office work to start a nomad life üåè. First, I want to set up my priorities &amp; start working on new projects. I'm very excited about this BIG change in my life. Stay tuned, I have a lot of plans! üéâ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/nomad?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#nomad</a></p>

	With this will change a lot of things in my current "normal" life. I wanted more time for traveling, for building my own ideas/projects, improve my English, meet new people and places, start healthier habits (exercise every day, maybe yoga or meditating, cook and eat better foot, sleep more, etc.). All of this is very exciting and sound nice, but to be able to accomplish this, first I have to create a valid routine for me (I know I'm very good procrastinator).
	Because of all of this, I will create a public calendar/schedule and TODO list, to be accountable and set clear fixed time goals (I'm inspired in @asimov) in order to be profitable in a minimum of one year.

<h2>Next month TODO list (04/06 - 04/07)</h2>
<ul>
 	<li class='listItem'>
 		<strong>Create a blog:</strong>
		<div>Creating a blog will have a lot of benefits for me. Writing publicly all my projects, todos, plans &amp; earnings makes me <b>accountable</b> and create a good habit (reviewing my daily work and expenses will make me more aware of my progress and adjust expenses). Writing will <b>improve my English</b> skills, improving my grammar and new vocabulary. And in addition, I will <b>recover a lost hobby</b> and hopefully create a community. Let's see...</div>

 		<strong>Plan where to travel</strong>

			<div> It seems easy, but I want to look carefully in order to not expend too much, I fixed a daily maximum amount in order to be able to `survive` with my savings for at least one year and a half. With little planning, you can save a lot with travels (with pages like <a href="http://www.skyscanner.com">Skyscanner</a>, where you can look for a flexible flight) and search for cheaper accommodation (house sharing, work while you stay in a hotel, etc.). As I have 1 month until my departure (I have already paid the rent for the whole June and I have <a href="http://www.sonar.es">some</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome">plans</a> for next month) therefor I have time to plan it. </div>

 		<strong>Prepare the travel</strong>

			<div> Prepare baggage: light clothes, medical &amp; personal care, electronics and prepare my laptop for a long (and unknown) travel. This last will be the more time consuming because I want to set up a my "<strong>personal office</strong>" in my own laptop and create some precautions (backups, encypt and protect folders/files, install project management tools, etc.). My plan is to be able to recover all my files/projects in 3 days maximum if some bad happens to my laptop. </div>

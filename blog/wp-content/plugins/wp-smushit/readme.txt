= Privacy =

Smush does not interact with end users on your website. The only input option Smush has is to a newsletter subscription for site admins only.

Smush uses a third-party email service (Drip) to send informational emails ( Opt-in) to the site administrator. The administrator's email address is sent to Drip and a cookie is set by the service. Only administrator information is collected by Drip.

Smush sends images to the WPMU DEV servers to optimize them for web use. This includes the transfer of EXIF data. The EXIF data will either be stripped or returned as it is. It is not stored on the WPMU DEV servers.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I just finished running Smush and Google Pagespeed still says my images need compressing and resizing. How do I fix it? =

This means your images were not properly scaled for where they are being displayed. Scaling images before uploading them can be time consuming but can save space and speedup load time. First, determine what size your image needs to be. You can use the built-in developer tools in Chrome or Firefox to find what height and width your image should be. Once you know how large the image should be, scale your images to the right size.


<strong>Tip:</strong> you may not be need to scale each image individually. If the images are in your Media Library, you may be able to fix them with a plugin.

= Does Smush delete or replace my original full-size images? =

Nope. WordPress crops and resizes every image you upload for embedding on your site. By default, Smush only compresses these cropped and resized images, not your original full-size images. To compress your original full-sized images use <a href="https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/wp-smush-pro/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme">Smush Pro</a>.

= What type of file should I use for my images (GIF, PNG, JPG)? =

GIF files are large and can’t be optimized much. They should only be used if the image is animated.


PNG is best for computer generated graphics (vectors, logos, fonts, etc.), images with few colors or images with transparency.


JPG should be used for photography or images with a lot of color variation.

= I’m a photographer can I keep all my EXIF data? =

Yes! EXIF data stores camera settings, focal length, date, time and location information in image files. EXIF data makes image files larger but if you are a photographer you may want to preserve this information. We have included the option to preserve EXIF image data in Smush.

= I just ran bulk smush and some of my images didn't get compressed? =

First, check to see if you're receiving any server errors. If your images seem to be processing correctly check the file size of the images being skipped. Images over 1mb will be skipped. To compress images up to 32mb get <a href="https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/wp-smush-pro/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=readme">Smush Pro</a>.

= I activated Smush and I don’t see any difference in image quality. How am I supposed to know if Smush is working? =

Great question! It is important to understand Smush is an optimization tool that uses lossless image compression to save disk storage space and speed up your site. Smush squeezes data from your image files that will save space, resize huge images, and improve speed without changing quality.

You can track file size changes in your media library, individual image savings, directory savings, and Smush total savings with Smush stats. If you want to see some additional magic, run before-and-after page-speed tests with WP Checkup or Google PageSpeed Insights. Every little bit of resource savings is important when it comes to page-speed!

= Can't I just use Photoshop or another image editing application to optimize my images? =

Optimizing all the image sizes generated by WordPress, images being imported from plugins and themes, and images from other web sites is a painful and time consuming process.

Smush automatically handles optimizing all your images no matter where they come from and  can be used as a standalone tool or alongside Photoshop.

= Is it optimize or optimise? =
It depends what side of the pond you live on...but whether you say optimize, optimise, optimizer or Smush goddess of speed this plugin will make sure your images are loading lighting fast.

== Screenshots ==

1. Watch as your image library is processed – up to 50 images at a time.
2. Set automatic smush to resize and optomize every image as it is uploaded.
3. Smush will find and optimize images for you.

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Configure your desired settings via the `Smush` settings page in dashboard area

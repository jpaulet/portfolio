== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the difference between "Free" and "Pro" versions? =

Free plugin is limited to one account per each type of connected networks. In other words you can add 1 Facebook, AND 1 Twitter AND 1 LinkedIn AND 1 etc ... accounts in the "Free" version. This is enough for about 95% of users.

<a href="https://www.nextscripts.com/social-networks-autoposter-wordpress-plugin-pro/">SNAP Pro Plugin</a> is NOT limited in number of accounts per each type of connected networks.  You can add 10 (or 100) Facebook, AND 15 Twitter AND 5 LinkedIn AND 25 etc ... accounts in the "Pro" version. 


= What networks in your auto-poster plugin are free and what are not? Why some networks are not free? =

Please see the answer here: <a href="https://www.nextscripts.com/snap-networks-free-vs-premium/">https://www.nextscripts.com/snap-networks-free-vs-premium/</a>

= Does the free plugin support Wordpress Multisite Network Edition (ex-WPMU)? =

*SNAP Free and SNAP Pro will work ONLY on one site in the WordPress Multisite Environment. You can chose which one in the network admin panel.
*<a href="https://www.nextscripts.com/social-networks-autoposter-wordpress-plugin-pro-multiuser/">SNAP Pro Multiuser</a> is fully compatible with WordPress Multisite Environment. It comes with admin panel where you can decide what sites can run SNAP or not

= Can I use it just for Twitter (Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest) or it requires all networks to be set? =

Sure you can use it for just one or two networks.

= Can it post to Facebook and Google+ pages? Not to profiles, but to pages. =

Yes, it can. Specify page in the "Where to Post" field in the account settings, and it will post to pages. 

= Why it's not so easy to setup? Why do I need all those apps? There are other plugins (Jetpack Publicize, Linksalpha Network Publisher, etc ) that could do it much easier. =

There is a major difference between SNAP and other auto-posting plugins. Plugin MUST use an "App" to make posts. if plugin doesn't ask you to create your own app, it will use an app set by plugin author. Yes, it's easier to setup but it means that with every post you make you will promote that plugin author to all your friends and followers. All those posts will be marked as "Shared via Wordpress.com" or "posted by Linksalpha". SNAP gives you an ability to setup your own apps and promote only yourself. We have a very detailed and illustrated setup instructions and our support can help you with that. We believe that it's well worth to spend your time by setting it up, instead of doing free advertisement for somebody else.
